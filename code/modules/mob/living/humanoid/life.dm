//NOTE: Breathing happens once per FOUR TICKS, unless the last breath fails. In which case it happens once per ONE TICK! So oxyloss healing is done once per 4 ticks while oxyloss damage is applied once per tick!

There are 50HP to get through, so (1/6)*last_tick_duration per second. Breaths however only happen every 4 ticks.
